Our very first step to learn terraform is to implement our first machine.

Lets see how simple and easy that is.

Quick Note:
There are thousands of AMI (instane types) you can use but we will use ubuntu as our main AMI for this course.

My region is eu-central-1 but you can use whichever region you like.
Every region have different AMI's availabe and you can look for relevant ubuntu instance AMI's in this link:
