Elastic IPs are very important to understand and implement when creating a new resource.
Elastic IPs are static ipv4 that will be attached to your resource upon creation.

When we have a server or service that we will have users log-into, we want to make sure that the server IP doesnt change.
This is where elastic IP can help us.
